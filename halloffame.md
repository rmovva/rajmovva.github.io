This page contains things that I like. Each entry is dated, because I don't know if they still resonate with me right now. But they were at some point important, and I'd like to recall the version of myself that resonated with them.

## Books

I log all the books I read on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139600509-rajiv-movva), often with written reviews, but these are some of my favorites.

- [Jan 2024] The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri. [My review.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6211603825)
- [Dec 2023] Stay True by Hua Hsu. Evoked a deep sense of nostalgia and gratitude for all kinds of relationships, including ones that have faded.
- [Jan 2023] The Secret to Superhuman Strength by Alison Bechdel.
- [Aug 2022] Pachinko by Min Jin Lee. [My review.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4678239248)
- [Apr 2022] Stone Butch Blues by Leslie Feinberg. The most moving book I've ever read.
- [Apr 2022] Giovanni's Room by James Baldwin.
- [Aug 2021] Minor Feelings by Cathy Park Hong.
- [Apr 2017] The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison. We read this in my high school American Lit class, and I hadn't read much like it before. It gave me new language (colorism, intersectionality) to understand the world around me.

## Movies

- [Dec 2023] The Holdovers, 2023, directed by Alexander Payne. Paul Giamatti is awesome, as is the supporting cast. The story is nothing new, but the cozy, realistic, nostalgic execution made it feel special.
- [Apr 2021] Nomadland, 2020, directed by Chloe Zhao
- [Jul 2020] The Florida Project, 2017, directed by Sean Baker 
- [Jul 2018] Boyhood, 2014, directed by Richard Linklater. I remember really not understanding this film when I watched it at age 15, and thinking I had out-grown its tropes a little on my 4th watch at 21. It feels precisely for 18-year-olds, no older and no younger.


## Miscellaneous

- [Apr 2023] Everything from [Diaspora Spice Company](https://diasporaco.com/).
