summary: How I've made my pies, breads, and cookies easier and/or yummier.

This recipe is a nice entry point into the experimentation-friendly world of homemade cocktail bitters. Grapefruit might just be my favorite point on the [citrus triangle]: it brings orange's sweetness, lemon's brightness, and its own unique floral citrusyness. Cocktail bitters are a perfect medium to distill this deliciousness into a concentrated tincture, and it's even more fun to accentuate grapefruit's flavor with supporting spices. All you have to do is steep things in vodka for a couple weeks, and you're set. I store my grapefruit bitters in a pint mason jar and add a barspoon to white negronis, pretty much any mezcal-based cocktail, or even just seltzer on ice. (Homemade bitters also make nice, batchable gifts, especially if you transfer them into [4oz dropper bottles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08656X5GB).)

A few notes. First, grapefruit has a relatively thick layer of bitter pith compared to most citrus. This is annoying when you're trying to eat pieces of grapefruit flesh, but we're making _bitters_ here! The pith is a feature, not a bug, so don't bother cutting it away from your swaths of zest. Second, the spice selection is **highly customizable** to your tastes and what you have on hand. I would say coriander and cinnamon are key – coriander has a nice lemony earthyness, and cinnamon adds sweet-spicy complexity – but beyond that, go wild (just err on the side of using very little of each spice, as some of them dominate quickly). For example, I didn't use cloves, but I think adding one clove could be nice. Third, I've listed gentian (the primary bittering agent in Campari and many other liqueurs) as optional; if you don't have it, add some extra pith to compensate.

### Recipe: Grapefruit Bitters (makes 12oz)

Ingredients:
- 8oz 40% cheap, neutral vodka
- 2oz inexpensive London dry gin (vodka is also fine)
- Zest of 2 large grapefruits 
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1 tsp coriander seed
- 1/4th of a small cinnamon stick
- 1/4 tsp pink peppercorns 
- 2 bay leaves
- _Optional:_ 1 tsp chopped gentian root
- _After steeping:_ 2-4oz simple syrup, to taste  

Steps:
1. Zest the grapefruit and lemon. If not using gentian, also cut some of the grapefruit pith to use for more bitterness.
2. Add vodka, gin (if using), citrus zest, and spices to a pint mason jar. Do not add simple syrup.
3. Let sit for 2 weeks. Shake every few days, and feel free to open and sniff (it should gradually get more delicious).
4. Strain the liquid through a coffee filter. Discard the citrus and reserve the remaining spices.
5. Make a spiced simple syrup by simmering the reserved spices in 2oz (1/4 cup) water and 2oz sugar. Start by adding 2oz of the syrup to the bitters, and add any additional syrup to taste.
6. Transfer the completed bitters to a clean mason jar or dropper bottles. Enjoy!
