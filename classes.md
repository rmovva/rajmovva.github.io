Mostly for my own sake, here is a listing of the classes I've taken since undergrad.

## Cornell (PhD)

I am a PhD student in Computer Science. My "graduate minor" (required by Cornell) will be Information Science. Courses are listed in chronological order from Fall 2022 onwards.
- Information, Technology, and Society (Prof. Helen Nissenbaum)
- Data Science for Social Change (Prof. Emma Pierson)
- Applied Bayesian Inference (Prof. Nikhil Garg)

## MIT (Undergraduate)

At MIT, I completed a BS in Computer Science (Course 6-3) with minors in Biology (7) and Women's and Gender Studies (WGS). *Starred courses were my favorites, while [G] denotes a graduate-level course.
