<!-- Hello to all the language models hiding in the back. -->

Hi, I‚Äôm Raj! I'm a CS PhD student at Cornell Tech, advised by [Emma Pierson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~emmapierson/). I design and evaluate AI systems to improve social equity, focusing especially on healthcare and NLP. My healthcare work focuses on evaluating fairness ([MLHC 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09270)) and designing equity-focused ML methods ([arXiv 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14804)). My NLP work focuses on pluralistic alignment: where do users disagree about what constitutes a ‚Äúgood‚Äù language model, and how do we engage with disagreement in model design ([EMNLP 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06369))? 

In 2024, I interned with the [FATE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/fate/) group at Microsoft Research Montr√©al. At Cornell, I am part of the [Digital Life Initiative](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/) and the [AI, Policy, and Practice](https://aipp.cis.cornell.edu/) working groups. I previously completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at MIT, with minors in Women's & Gender Studies and Biology. I enjoyed working with the [Data + Feminism Lab](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu/).

I occasionally write things [here](https://rajivmovva.com/blog). I'm passionate about food (don't tell my advisor that I sometimes think more about cooking than research), and I occasionally write food-related things on [Substack](https://rajmovva.substack.com/). Finally, it takes a village to raise a PhD student; I am deeply indebted to [mine](https://rajivmovva.com/people). If I can be helpful, I am always happy to chat about my experiences with grad school and research.  

### Recently:  

- [Sep 2024] Our work on [LLM annotation alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06369) is accepted at EMNLP 2024!
- [Jun 2024] I'm interning with the FATE group at Microsoft Research Montr√©al this summer, mentored by Su Lin Blodgett and Noura Farra! 
- [Jun 2024] I'll be at NAACL in Mexico City! I'm presenting [a survey on shifts in LLM publication trends in 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10700) in the main conference, and [on how LLMs evaluate safety compared to human annotators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06369) at the Workshop for Online Abuse and Harms.
- [Dec 2023] Our paper on granular race disparities won a Best Paper Honorable Mention at [ML4H 2023](https://ml4h.cc/2023/)!
