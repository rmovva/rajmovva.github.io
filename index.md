Hi, I’m Raj, a CS PhD student at Cornell Tech in NYC. I work on developing responsible, human-centered AI. My recent focuses have been measuring social discrimination and improving health equity with machine learning.  

<!-- Advised by Profs. [Emma Pierson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~emmapierson/) and [Nikhil Garg](https://gargnikhil.com/), -->

Previously, I studied CS at MIT with minors in Biology and Women’s & Gender Studies. There, I worked in the [Data + Feminism Lab](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu/) with Prof. Catherine D'Ignazio and Dr. Harini Suresh to develop intersectional, participatory ML systems ([FAccT 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533132)). Before that, I worked with Prof. Michael Carbin and Dr. Jonathan Frankle on pruning and sparsity in neural networks, across [vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14753) and [language](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.blackboxnlp-1.19/).  

I hew closely to PhD stereotypes: my primary hobbies are baking, lifting weights, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139600509-rajiv-movva), mixology, and tennis. If you'd like to read some unreliable recipes I've written, see [here](https://rajivmovva.com/recipes).  

### Updates

- [2023-04] [Our new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09270) is on arXiv, the first from my PhD! We find that granular race categories are critical to algorithmic fairness analyses in healthcare; [here's](https://twitter.com/rajivmovva/status/1651237859465080834) a summary.
- [2022-08] [Our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09684) on compressing language models is accepted to COLING 2022! I led this project during an Apple internship in 2021.
- [2022-04] In the Fall, I'll start my PhD at Cornell Tech in NYC.
- [2022-04] I was awarded an NSF Graduate Fellowship!

<!-- Though it's no longer my main interest, I'm also passionate about computational biology, including [functional epigenomics](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218073) and ligand-protein binding prediction. My favorite hobby is cooking, along with other stereotypical grad student activities: lifting weights, baking, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139600509-rajiv-movva), and playing tennis. You can find some of my [recipes](https://rajivmovva.com/recipes) here (it's a WIP). -->

<!-- While there, I worked with Prof. Catherine D’Ignazio and student Harini Suresh at the [Data + Feminism Lab](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu/). Collaborating with activist groups, we co-designed NLP models to support the difficult labor of tracking gender-based violence ([Best Paper, FAccT 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533132)). The project taught me that naive ML systems often fail at the margins – it takes effort and care to design models for specific, intersectional contexts. -->

<!-- Before that, I explored neural network compression, i.e. improving memory & compute efficiency to mitigate AI’s consumptive footprint. Mentored by Jonathan Frankle, I tested an approach for [parallelized pruning of neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14753). During an internship at Apple, I [combined compression techniques](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.252/) to rein in the compute footprint of large language models. I also earned Best Paper at BlackboxNLP 2020 for studying how [pruning affects interpretability](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.blackboxnlp-1.19/) in Transformers.  -->
