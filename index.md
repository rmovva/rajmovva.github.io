Hi, I’m Raj, a CS PhD student at Cornell Tech in NYC. I work on developing responsible, human-centered AI. Advised by Profs. Emma Pierson and Nikhil Garg, my recent focuses have been measuring social discrimination and improving health equity with machine learning.

Previously, I studied CS at MIT with minors in Biology and Women’s & Gender Studies. While there, I worked with Prof. Catherine D’Ignazio and student Harini Suresh at the [Data + Feminism Lab](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu/). Collaborating with activist groups, we co-designed NLP models to support the difficult labor of tracking gender-based violence ([Best Paper, FAccT 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533132)). The project taught me that naive ML systems often fail at the margins – it takes effort and care to design models for specific, intersectional contexts.

Before that, I explored neural network compression, i.e. improving memory & compute efficiency to mitigate AI’s consumptive footprint. Mentored by Jonathan Frankle, I tested an approach for [parallelized pruning of neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14753). During an internship at Apple, I [combined compression techniques](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.252/) to rein in the compute footprint of large language models. I also earned Best Paper at BlackboxNLP 2020 for studying how [pruning affects interpretability](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.blackboxnlp-1.19/) in Transformers. 

Though it's no longer my main interest, I'm also passionate about computational biology, including [functional epigenomics](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218073) and ligand-protein binding prediction. My favorite hobby is cooking, along with other stereotypical grad student activities: lifting weights, baking bread, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139600509-rajiv-movva), and parenting plants.
